## Overview
Gu-Ru Studios makes it easy for parents to choose their favorite schedule and mentor for their children. This landing page highlights key values (easy, curated, and trusted) through conversion heroes, mentor cards, and clear CTAs. My role focused on copy, systematic layout, and UI components consistent with the design system.
